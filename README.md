# Password-Generator
Code Refactoring

This project was part of a "code refactoring". The goal is to refactor a code and fix the issue with the password generator. 
We were given all of the necessary files for this project which included the .html, .css, and .js file. The focus was mainly on the javascript file as we had to create and output a random generated password using prompts. 
We were given a 'User story' and an 'Acceptance Criteria' for this project. Listed below are the 'Acceptance Criteria'.

CHALLENGES

This project was very challenging for me. In comparison to .html and .css, javascript to me is quite difficult. The lines of code seem to confuse me. Even with the access to materials and resources, understanding javascript is difficult. 
Therefore, in order to complete this project I had to go over all of my notes/resources. I read tutorials on W3schools website and understoods the meanings of the line of codes on Mozilla website.
I also watch a lot of videos online just to understand how and why everything works. With that, I was able to complete the project. I understand the variables and understood how to use 'if', 'while', and 'for' statements.
Although I was able to complete the project, I am still not confident in javascript coding. This project did help me understand a bit more about how javascript coding works. I will still need to practice more on javascript.

THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt

THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered

THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

In my repository contains an 'images' folder, which are my screenshots for the website. I have a 'script.js with comments' folder. This folder is a copy of my script.js, but with comments. I wrote the comments for myself, so that I could understand what the line of code meant. Lastly I have my 'index.html', 'script.js', 'style.css', 'LICENSE', and 'README.md' file.
